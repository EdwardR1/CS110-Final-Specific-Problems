# Have the user input a word and print out the following:
    # Capitalise the first character of the word
    # Checks if the word they input ends with a specific character (you can choose)
    # Ask the user for another word and see if its inside the first word
        # Find the index value of a word if its found
# Ask the user for two words, add the two words together without using “+”
# Ask the user for a word and check if its all lowercase, if its not, send it all to lowercase
# Ask the user for a word and switch all the uppercase characters with lowercase characters
# **For all of them, remove any whitespace in front or behind the words they put in
# Ask the user for a word, a character, and a character to replace the first character with.
