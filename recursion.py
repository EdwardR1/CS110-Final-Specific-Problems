# Create a function that asks for an initial index. Using a string that’s defined outside of the function, read if the length of the string = the index and return 0.
# If not, count up until the index equates to the length of the string returning the length of the string from that index basically.

# Example:
# String = “Hello”
# print(Length(0)) # Prints out 5
# print(Length(1)) # Prints out 4

# String = “Computer Science”
# print(Length(10)) # Prints out 6

def length(i):
