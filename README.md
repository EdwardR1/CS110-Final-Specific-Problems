# Final-Specific-Problems
Questions to help for the Final with Starter code to use

## Notes

  - Download all the files from the Download button on the top right, then open the python files / folders with the topics you want to go more in depth with. 
  - Meaning, any topic you aren't comfortable with, go in and try the question in the file. 
  - The **files** topic is in the folder called *Files*, the **Web Apps** topic is in the folder called *WebApps*.
  - Topics such as Binary or Boolean are in the *NonProgrammingProblems.txt* file. 
  - Everything else in is in a python file. 
  - Some files have starter code, some don't, but they all have some basic instructions / prompts for what to do. 
  - Give it a try and see what you can do.
